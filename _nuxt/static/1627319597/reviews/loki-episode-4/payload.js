Not that I didn't the first time around, and there are still things that I think are enormous shifts at this point in the story. I mean... think about it, we last saw Loki and Mobius together before Loki disappeared through the time door with Sylvie in RoxxCart in episode 2. In episode 3, we didn't catch up with the TVA agents at all. And now in episode 4, Mobius and Hunter B-15 are both going to quickly switch allegiances and assist the two Loki variants. Now, in episode 2 we did see Loki tugging at the threads of Mobius' beliefs pertaining to the TVA, and he himself questions the Time-Keepers to an extent. We also do see Sylvie enchant Hunter B-15. But is it just me, or did their relatively quick shifts in allegiance not feel all that believable? They should be starting to question the TVA, absolutely, but this is somewhere they've spent presumably a very long time working and believing in; does it really make a ton of sense how quickly they both turned sides and actually helped the Lokis, knowing full well those Lokis plans were to tear down this institution and possibly cause uncountable casualties of their friends and colleagues along the way? I just wish there'd been a little more there, before the shift. Mobius' change I would say is the more believable, as he's been a Loki stan since episode 1, but Hunter B-15... I could've used a little more before she burst in to save both Lokis in the nick of time and threw Sylvie her machete, literally a weapon that would be used to kill B-15's colleagues..."}]},{type:a,value:b},{type:c,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Anyway... Apart from that, I really loved this episode. It moves at a mile a minute, with reveal-after-reveal, twist-after-twist and cameo-after-cameo. It's a lot! And it's so good!"}]},{type:a,value:b},{type:c,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"We start by meeting the Time-Keepers. Didn't expect that so soon. I was absolutely expecting that they'd be revealed to be a myth or fake in some sense, but I thought an actual reveal of them would come later... maybe at the end of one episode, to be shown as fake in the finale. This is the beginning of episode 4 and we've gotten a quick glimpse of them as Renslayer goes to confront them, presumably to discuss the fact that they've now misplaced two Lokis."}]},{type:a,value:b},{type:c,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Back on Lamentis-1, Loki and Sylvie bond over mutual feelings at the end of the world. They question whether it is a Loki's place to lose, and Loki tries to reassure Sylvie. He tells her how impressive she is and, in doing so, how impressive the Loki spirit truly is; it's tenacious, unrelenting even against having been killed a dozen times. This admiration between the two of them seems to trigger a nexus event - puzzling, because it's the end of a world and all events here should presumably be wiped from the timeline, but this happens. And it's no small blip; whatever has happened here, this admiration, love or self-assurance and respect the two of them have found is a huge nexus-level event. This leads to their being found and brought back in by the TVA."}]},{type:a,value:b},{type:c,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Loki and Sylvie are held separately, and Loki is thrown into a time cell which seems to loop an event from Loki's past. In this case we get a cameo from Jaimie Alexander reprising her role as Lady Sif. She has essentially one line which she repeats across numerous loops, slapping and punching Loki in the face, and kneeing him in the groin. She's confronting him for having cut her hair as a prank, and she is telling him that he will always be alone. The cycle does wear Loki down and he yields finally with an admission that he is a narcissist, desperate not to be alone so he lashes out with cruel humour, but it isn't funny. Loki seems to realise that his narcissism and use of cruel humour pushes people away, and that this is not something he truly wants but it is a defense mechanism."}]},{type:a,value:b},{type:c,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Loki tells Mobius that the TVA are lying to him, and in the meantime Hunter B-15 confronts Sylvie about her enchantment and essentially learns the same thing.
