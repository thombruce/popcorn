Okay, Loki episode 2, The Variant, might be the best episode of Marvel Cinematic Universe TV yet. I'm not sure whether or not it's my favourite - I still really love those early episodes of WandaVision that gave us that totally unexpected for the MCU classic sitcom format. But dang, it was exciting and dramatic and, quite possibly, far-reaching in terms of consequences for the MCU. Or... not. We could see all of these tied up in a neat little bow by the end of the series. I don't think we will see that, just based on what's known about upcoming movies, but it might go that way and those exciting details and rumours might be explained away some other way. But... maybe - and this is exciting - maybe...

We learn that they've caught dozens of variant Loki's before, and see a brief glimpse of some of the variant forms they take. There's a blue Loki who has embraced the frost giant in himself, a championship athlete Loki, a hulked out Loki, a barbarian Loki, etc. but they all pretty much have in common the face of Tom Hiddleston. There's some slight and not-so-slight variations in form, yeah, but these Lokis seemingly all start out the same way and veer off the \"sacred timeline\" at various points."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"After trying his hand at some mischief to get the better of his new TVA colleagues (or captors), our Loki is put back in his place - the TVA aren't so easily manipulated.

And in the next scene, we see Loki as a giddy little kid discussing his finding with Mobius which... relatable. I get the sense that I'd be the same; yes, my home planet has been destroyed, very sad, but here's this amazing clue I found! Loki gets the opportunity to show off how clever he is by suggesting that the variant Loki they are hunting could be hiding in apocalypses."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Because an apocalypse-level event destroys almost everything around it, Loki theorises that no amount of disruption to the proper flow of events would register a divergence from the timeline - it would be erased by the apocalypse anyway, it is a perfect place to hide in time. To test this, they visit Pompeii at the eruption of Mount Vesuvius and Loki gets to act out as much mischief as he likes before the volcano erupts, all of his actions registering precisely... zero variance energy. He was right!"}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"I love this idea. It's a clever time-travel conceit I've not seen done before, and is consistent with the lore of the TVA and the MCU's depictions of time travel so far. Time travel can make for dangerous storytelling, as it's easy to create contradictions in the internal logic of it, but I think the MCU has done this beautifully so far."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Finally, Loki and Mobius pinpoint what they think is likely to be the precise apocalypse their variant Loki is hiding in: Haven Hills, Alabama, 2050 - a town destined to be obliterated by a hurricane.

The variant continues to enchant the minds of character after character in this scene, in fact, and it's delightful seeing numerous actors perform with Hiddleston's Loki mannerisms. The variant leads Loki about the store in these disguises, stalling with him for time, before finally revealing... herself, her true form, a woman variant of Loki with a subtle horned crown, played by Sophia Di Martino. She earlier retches at the name Loki, and is still only credited (in most languages) as 'The Variant'. And I love her. We see her for what, twenty seconds? But I love her.

The reservation I have is... maybe they don't do that, maybe Marvel and Disney shy away (again) from that kind of positive representation. But so far, so good... and what a wild series.
