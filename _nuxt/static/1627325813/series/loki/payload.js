Now, in episode 2 we did see Loki tugging at the threads of Mobius' beliefs pertaining to the TVA, and he himself questions the Time-Keepers to an extent. We also do see Sylvie enchant Hunter B-15. But is it just me, or did their relatively quick shifts in allegiance not feel all that believable? They should be starting to question the TVA, absolutely, but this is somewhere they've spent presumably a very long time working and believing in; does it really make a ton of sense how quickly they both turned sides and actually helped the Lokis, knowing full well those Lokis plans were to tear down this institution and possibly cause uncountable casualties of their friends and colleagues along the way? I just wish there'd been a little more there, before the shift. Mobius' change I would say is the more believable, as he's been a Loki stan since episode 1, but Hunter B-15...

Okay, Loki episode 2, The Variant, might be the best episode of Marvel Cinematic Universe TV yet.

But dang, it was exciting and dramatic and, quite possibly, far-reaching in terms of consequences for the MCU. Or... not. We could see all of these tied up in a neat little bow by the end of the series. I don't think we will see that, just based on what's known about upcoming movies, but it might go that way and those exciting details and rumours might be explained away some other way.

There's a blue Loki who has embraced the frost giant in himself, a championship athlete Loki, a hulked out Loki, a barbarian Loki, etc. but they all pretty much have in common the face of Tom Hiddleston.
