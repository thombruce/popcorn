He is laughed out of the room, but before he leaves he is introduced to yet more Lokis, a whole group of them led by President Loki - yet another comics reference. President Loki is here to claim the throne in this underground bunker, which is... a very Loki move. So narcissistic, so backstabbing he'd fight all other Lokis to be ruler of this wasteland. But he too is in the presence of Lokis, so backstab leads to backstab and an all out Loki brawl breaks out which is... maybe right now one of my favourite scenes in the entirety of the MCU. Our Loki manages to escape with Classic Loki, Kid Loki and Lokigator, all of them seemingly embarrassed by the nature of Lokis. These three who have escaped with our Loki agree to help him with his cause, to kill Alioth."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Meanwhile in the TVA, Sylvie has interrogated Renslayer to find out enough information about the end of time to trust that that is where Loki has been sent.

This is the second time we've seen Loki achieving something stronger than we realised he could. We saw it in episode 4, where he telekinetically prevented a building from crushing Sylvie and himself, and now we've seen it directly called out with this magnificent illusion of Asgard. I think next episode we're going to see Loki do something absolutely fantastic to conclude that thread. It's possible their great feat is just enchanting Alioth, but Sylvie already believed she could do that, so I think we're to expect a big power play from Loki in the finale. And it's almost here! The finale is next week, and there is no big villain for the series yet explicitly shown or stated. That's bold. Could the big bad behind the TVA be Kang the Conqueror or one of his forms, or could it be another Loki... My expectation is that it's too late in the series to introduce a new character to general audiences, so we'll probably see a worst version of Loki, a King Loki perhaps who won and who sees other Lokis as his main rivals in all of time. But we'll see."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"This series has been wonderful and constantly surprising.
